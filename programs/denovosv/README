here's a stable version of ad hoc tools used to derive large SVs from NGS with denovo assembled contigs


REQUIRED Packages

python 2.7 (but included argparse.py for older versions)
numpy


WORKFLOW

the basic workflow is as such:

NGS output (e.g. fastq)
     |
Denovo assembly (e.g. SOAPdenovo)
(fasta file with all contigs/scaffolds)
     |
Alignment to reference
(currently just BLAST with output format 6)
(with gapopen and extend penalty (e.g. 2,1))
(XXXX.blast6)
     |
Get SV from single sample
denovo_sv.py (use python denovo_sv.py -h for help)
(XXXX.raw)
     |
Combine SV across samples
combine_denovo_sv.py (use python combine_denovo_sv.py -h for help)
('final' output)


FILES INCLUDED

denovo_sv.py 
combine_denovo_sv.py
scaffolds.py (backend of denovo_sv.py)
argparse.py (included for compatibility with older python)
6901.scafSeq (sample input:scaff of denovo_sv.py)
6901.scafSeq.blast6 (sample input:blast of denovo_sv.py)
6901.raw (sample output of denovo_sv.py)     
sample_combined_sv.txt (sample output of combine_denovo_sv.py)

note that all sample input/output are truncated to reduce download size


OUTPUT FILE FORMAT (in order of columns)

* denovo_sv.py 
type of event
breakpoint 1 chromosome
breakpoint 1 coordinate
breakpoint 2 chromosome
breakpoint 2 coordinate
number of N between aligned fragments on scaffold (indicate scaffolding, may be bad quality)
number of bases between aligned fragments on contig/scaffold
number of bases between aligned fragments on reference
infered from which contig/scaffold

* combine_denovo_sv.py
type of event
breakpoint 1 chromosome
breakpoint 1 coordinate
breakpoint 2 chromosome
breakpoint 2 coordinate
allele frequency of events with no N between breakpoints
allele frequency of events
allele frequency of events, allowing multiple from same sample; may indicate merging of 2 events into 1 if higher than last column
distance between breakpoints on contig/scaffold
distance between breakpoints on reference
comma separated list of samples containing this event
